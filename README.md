## An Aspect Ratio Analyzer written in Python

This project is my intro to GUI development using Python.  I'm brand new to programming and always wanted to create a functioning app with a GUI to handle monotonous tasks at work or even better, solve a problem that my co-workers thought was something they would just have to deal with.

Because this is my **first rodeo** I'm sure the code will be chock full of inefficient loops and bugs, but being a noob my focus of course is just getting the functions to run.  I've been working on this project for probably 5 months before joining github so the app is already functioning for the most part, but it needs polish and tweaks of course.  For instance I probably can't leave the Pokemon characters my son loves as the buttons on the GUI, at least not if anyone seriously uses the app.  Which brings me to my next point.  My hope is that someone out there will find this app useful.  I'm sure there are probably multiple apps that do the same thing, but there is nothing wrong with duplicates when you're looking to solve a problem.

The goal is to expand this app to not only analyze frames and report differences in aspect ratios, but also compare quality and report major differences for quality control and possibly apply some object recognition to allow for searching video files for specific objects like cats, trees, light-sabers, etc.

### More to come!
